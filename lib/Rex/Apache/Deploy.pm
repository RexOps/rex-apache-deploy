 deploy_to "/var/deploy";
   
 document_root "/var/www/myhost/htdocs";
   
 generate_deploy_directory sub {
    my ($file) = @_;
    $file =~ m/-(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\.tar\.gz$/;

=head1 DEPLOY METHODS

=over 4

=item Symlink

This method will upload your package (*.tar.gz, *.tar.bz2 or *.zip) all you servers and extract it in the directory you specified with I<deploy_to> concatenated with the result of I<generate_deploy_directory>. After that it will create a symlink from I<document_root> to this new directory.

 deploy_to "/var/deploy";
 document_root "/var/www";
 generate_deploy_directory sub { return "1.0"; };

This will upload the file to I</var/deploy/1.0> and create a symlink from I</var/www> to I</var/deploy/1.0>.

=item Tomcat

This method is for Tomcat deployments. You need to have the Tomcat Manage application running on your Tomcat servers. It will upload your package to I</tmp/some-random-chars.war>, call the Tomcat Manager to undeploy the current context and deploy the new war archive. After that it will delete the uploaded temporary war file.

 context_path "/myapp";
     
 task "deploy", group => "middleware", sub {
     deploy "myapp.war",
         username    => "manager-user",
         password    => "manager-password",
         port        => 8080,
         manager_url =>  "/manager";
 };

This will deploy I<myapp.war> to the tomcat listening on port I<8080> with the manager application found under I<http://the-server:8080/manager>.
